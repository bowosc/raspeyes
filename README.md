<p> This is the backend code for the Raspberry-Pi-4-powered smart glasses. </p>
<p> The glasses take audio input and transcribe it to live subtitles, using OpenAI's open-source Whisper model. </p>
<p> The glasses also will take physical input from hand motions, allowing for the creation of a basic UI for greater functionality.</p>
