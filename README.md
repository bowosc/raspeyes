The backend code for a pair of Raspberry-Pi-powered smart glasses.
The glasses take audio input and transcribe it to live subtitles, using OpenAI's open-source Whisper model. 
The glasses also will take physical input from hand motions, allowing for the creation of a basic UI for greater functionality.
